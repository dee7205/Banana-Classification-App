# 🧠 Sweet Spot Classification Models

This directory contains the trained deep learning models used for the **Sweet Spot** Banana Ripeness Classification System.

## 📂 Model Files

All models are saved in **TorchScript (`.pt`)** format. This format includes both the model architecture and the learned weights, allowing them to be loaded without requiring external class definitions.

| Model Architecture | Filename | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GiMaTag CNN** | `gimatag_complete.pt` | A custom 3-block Convolutional Neural Network designed specifically for this study. |
| **VGG19** | `vgg19_complete.pt` | Transfer learning model based on VGG19 (ImageNet weights), fine-tuned for banana ripeness. |
| **ResNet50** | `resnet50_complete.pt` | Transfer learning model based on ResNet50 (ImageNet weights), providing deep residual learning capabilities. |

## 🚀 How to Load

These models are optimized for deployment and should be loaded using `torch.jit.load()` rather than the standard `torch.load()`.
```python
import torch

# Define device
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Load the model
model = torch.jit.load("models/resnet50_complete.pt", map_location=device)
model.eval()
```

## 🛠 Model Generation
These .pt files were generated by tracing the original PyTorch state dictionaries (.pth files). The conversion scripts ensured that the architecture definitions were bundled with the weights.

Source: Trained on the GiMaTag Banana Dataset.
Input Size: 224x224 RGB Images.
Normalization: Mean [0.485, 0.456, 0.406], Std [0.229, 0.224, 0.225].
